# GIAinv
# this project contains Matlab scripts and dataset to separate Glacial Isostatic Adjustment (GIA) signal and Present Day Surace Mass Change (PDSMC) signal in contemporary GNSS observations and GRACE data.
# the main matlab function is GIA_inv_GPS_GRACE.m and it has comments that explain the function
# to help with a trial run we also provide some sample data (such as Caron_stokes.mat, ICE_6GD_stokes.mat, GRACE_trebd_Data.mat, GPSloc_vec.mat, and GPS_trend_vec.mat)
# User may follow the example in GIA_inv_GPS_GRACE.m to obtain a GIA field or PDSMC field from the dataset.
# the file: GIA_output_GNSS_GRACE_ice6G_purcell.mat contains the GIA field that we obtained for the publication.
# please cite the relevant publication when using this work.
